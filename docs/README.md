## Bottom Line Up Front

### This is a Solution Blueprint

This _living document_ delivers a "flight path" or adoption journey using IBM Client Engineering's Value Engineering Method. The flight path is an open blueprint for a successful implementation for a _Proof of Concept_ aimed at adopting **IBM Aspera Sync** at one of IBM's customers. The solution aims to address the business need to provide high-speed, highly-scalable, multi-directional, file-based replication and synchronization.

The Value Engineering Method is a human and design-led approach to solve complex business problems with transformative technology. This approach uses a proven co-creation methodology that aligns our experts, utilize leadership based on thousands of projects, with key client stakeholders to quickly identify business or technology challenges and build Proof of Experiences (PoXs) that solve and ‘de-risk’ those problems using IBM technology.

### Working In The Open

The Flight Path approach embodies IBM Client Engineering's dedication to transparency and collaboration, which is evident through the creation of this accessible repository that showcases real-life customer experiences. By sharing this knowledge, IBM aims to develop user-friendly and scalable landing zones for customers that encourage the adoption of IBM Technology while prioritizing innovation and user experience. This repository represents IBM Client Engineering's commitment to _working in the open_, where stakeholders and interested parties can participate, provide feedback and benefit from collective knowledge.
