- We went through logging

## Issues/questions faced

- Customer would like to disable `Sync Session Stats` from logs and only show errors
- Customer wants Aspera to run like a batch job instead of syncing 24/7
- Customer wants to know more about Aspera console and adding new aspera server to managed nodes

## Currently Tracking

- Customer will continue to play around with Aspera Sync
