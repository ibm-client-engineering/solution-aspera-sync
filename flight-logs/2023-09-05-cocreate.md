## Issues/questions faced

- Desired customer transfer user was not made properly and had issues such as not being in `/etc/passwd`.
- Client had two servers, A and B. A was unable to initiate sync to B while B was able to do it to A. It was later confirm that there was conflicting policies on A only.
